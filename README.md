Google Play Game Services RoboVM Bindings Attempt
====================================

Bindings for google play game services for RoboVM.
Only GPGAchievement is implemented.

I do not know how to test my work and I don't know if everything is correct.
I added some questions where there is uncertainty to the code.

I used the following resources to create my code:
Class reference: https://developers.google.com/games/services/ios/api/interface_g_p_g_achievement
objC header: (download) https://developers.google.com/games/services/downloads/PlayGameServices.v1.1.zip
Bro guide: https://github.com/robovm/robovm/wiki/The-Bro-Java-to-native-bridge

It would be awesome if someone could give me some feedback, so that I can continue my work knowing I'm doing it right. :)

On top of the questions in the code, I would like to know how to add the library to my project.
Google provides a .bundle and .framework folder. Where should I place those? 
Or should I convert it somehow to a single file and place it in the libs folder?

Thank you!
